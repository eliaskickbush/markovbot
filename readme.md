# Markov Bot

This is a very simple, inefficient and na√Øve bot that uses pseudo Markov chains to generate text based on a database of previous known texts.

## Overview

There are two classes, first the DatabaseDriver, which is a simple abstraction on top of *sqlite3* that is used to store words and their succesors, while also offering a method to query a particular words' successors.

This class is used by the actual bot which is implemented in the Markov Bot class, which offers methods to digest new text and generate texts.

## Usage

```[python]
from main import MarkovBot

# test here refers to the database filename
bot = MarkovBot('test') 

to_digest = """
    But there is something that I must say to my people, who stand on the warm threshold which leads into the palace of justice: In the process of gaining our rightful place, we must not be guilty of wrongful deeds. Let us not seek to satisfy our thirst for freedom by drinking from the cup of bitterness and hatred. We must forever conduct our struggle on the high plane of dignity and discipline. We must not allow our creative protest to degenerate into physical violence. Again and again, we must rise to the majestic heights of meeting physical force with soul force.
"""
bot.digest_text(to_digest)
# Here 'that' refers to first word of text and 10 to word limit of text
text = bot.generate_text('that', 10)
# text should be something like:
#   'that I must forever conduct our creative protest to degenerate into'
```
